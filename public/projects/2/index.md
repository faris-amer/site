# WFR24 Power distribution Board

![](/projects/2/image.png)

The first PCB I ever designed, made to distribute power from the LV battery of our vehicle to the rest of the car, and to switch to a high-voltage DC-DC when it is available. The switching logic was done using a dedicated [power path controller IC](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/4412fb.pdf) which I found very easy to use, and the fuses are just blade fuse holders, the same kind you'd find in a normal car. 

Looking back at it, there were a few things I could have done better, but it served as a really important milestone, and the lessons I learned from this board carried on into my future designs.
