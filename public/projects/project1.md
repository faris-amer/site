# Formula SAE Overview

hello: $$x+y=5$$

Formula SAE is an annual competition hosted by SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) in North America, where student teams compete against each other, building a formula-style open-wheeled vehicle and competing in different events to display their engineering knowledge.
## Why Compete?
The point of this competition is to produce excellent engineers. Companies pour thousands into sponsoring this event, both to the event directly and by sponsoring teams, to build better engineers. If companies can make *you* graduate a better engineer, they get to hire better engineers, it's a win-win scenario! ~~(they win twice)~~ Every aspect of this competition is aimed at improving your engineering skills, so make that your main intention going into this.

From the first line in the 2025 rulebook:

*SAE International's Collegiate Design Series (CDS) programs prepare undergraduate and
graduate engineering students in a variety of disciplines for future employment in mobility-
related industries by challenging them with a real world, engineering application.
Through the Engineering Design Process, experiences may include but are not limited to:
• Project management, budgeting, communication, and resource management skills
• Team collaboration
• Applying industry rules and regulations
• Design, build, and test the performance of a real vehicle
• Interact and compete with other students from around the globe
• Develop and prepare technical documentation
Students also gain valuable exposure to and engagement with industry professionals to
enhance 21st century learning skills, to build their own network and help prepare them for the
workforce after graduation.*

These SAE [student competitions](https://www.sae.org/attend/student-events) include our sister teams Baja SAE and SAE Aero Design.
## The Competition
The competition consists of a few days of technical inspection, followed by **static events** and **dynamic events.**

### Technical Inspection

Before you are allowed to compete, you are subjected to ~2 full days of scrutiny by many tech inspectors who are experts in their fields, and will grill you to ensure your car follows the rulebook to a T. If anything is off, you will be sent back and made to fix whatever issue it is they had with your car. You're allowed to re-tech as many times as possible, but there is a long lineup of other teams waiting to go, and limited time to get everything done.

Tech consists of 6 parts:
1. **Accumulator tech**: where your accumulator is opened up, and your battery is inspected. After accu tech, the lid is taped on, and you are not allowed to open it up for the rest of the duration of the competition (barring special exemption.)
2. **Mechanical tech:** The entire car, minus battery, is inspected for mechanical fitness, down to every single bolt and nut, the materials used, clearances, etc. (we have been sent back for a bolt being one thread too short!)
3. **EV Tech:** After your accumulator and car are inspected individually, the battery gets put in the car, and they test your car's electrical integration. This is where the car turns on for the first time, and we test motor spin, grounding, all the e-stops and safety devices, etc.
4. **Tilt test:** They tilt your car, and see if anything falls out or comes loose (really)
5. **Rain test:** You turn your car on, and then shower it with water for 3 minutes, then wait 1 minute to make sure the car doesn't fail due to water ingress.
6. **Brakes test:** You accelerate, then hit the brakes as hard as possible. If you lock up and slide on all 4 wheels, you pass.
You can always compete in static events, but to compete in dynamic events, you need to pass every step of tech inspection.
### Static Events
The static events are worth a total of 325 points:

**Presentation: 75 points** - Changes every year, members of the team have to give a more business-oriented presentation on some topic that the organizers choose, totally decoupled from your team's specific vehicle design/

**Cost: 100 Points** - The team must put together a cost report, where the price of everything on the car is listed, and then defend it in front of judges, showing that we made good use of our budget, and made good decisions when spending our money. 

**Design: 150 Points** - The subsystem leads bring the car to a panel of expert judges, who then question every subsystem and judge their design decisions. This is one of the most important events, as we usually get valuable feedback, and being prepared for design means we know our car inside-out. 
### Dynamic Events
The Dynamic Events are worth a total of 675 points:

**Acceleration: 100 Points** - A 75m dash, fastest time wins. This tests your raw motor power, and ability to grip the ground.

**Skid Pad: 75 Points** - 4 laps in a figure 8, fastest time wins. This tests your suspension and ability to take turns at speed.

**Autocross: 125 Points** - A tight race course with bends, sharp corners, straights, etc. Fastest time wins. This tests overall vehicle performance and driver skill.

**Endurance: 275 Points** - The biggest event of the competition, it's a grueling 22 kilometer race that tests your vehicle's ability to go the distance without breaking down or losing power. If any issues arise and the car has to stop, the event is over and you are marked DNF. Out of ~80 teams in 2024, only 24 managed to pass tech and finish endurance. 

**Efficiency: 100 Points** - This is based on your endurance run, and tests how efficient you were with your energy during the run. This includes any energy regained from regenerative braking.

## How do we get there?
Now that we know our goal - a well-engineered performance electric vehicle - where do we start? 

Thankfully, as a team, we have a good base to work with, so what we need to focus on is improvement. This is where your ES1050 training comes in: iterative design.
Every year after competition, we get together and go over what went well, what didn't, what we want to improve, etc. This sets the rough scope and budget for the year. The decisions we make depend on many things, primarily our manpower and our budget. The more people and money we have, the more things we can do! So then we spend a few months in the design/prototyping stage, and then start building the car around the start of second semester.

That's all for this section, hopefully this was a good intro to the team, the competition, and what our goals are as a team. Make sure to question ***everything***, remember, we're all students at the end of the day!
