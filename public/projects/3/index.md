What goes into creating a fully-custom electric racecar? And how the hell do we build this thing in 10 months? 

These were the questions I was asking myself in August of 2024, when I became a full-fledged member of the electrical team of the university's coolest (no bias) build team. I was tasked with laying out and manufacturing the low voltage system of car, inclduing wiring, connectors, component placement, and much more. I was part of a small and focused electrical team that had to do big things with very limited resources.

After witnessing the disaster of the previous year, having a beautiful car with a great mechanical design that could not run due to faulty wiring and an unreliable (and unsafe!) electrical system, I was dead set on creating a robust strategy that would stand the test of the rest of the team harsh track conditions and months of testing. I started by creating a high-level block diagram of the entire vehicle, to get an idea of what had to be connected where, and what we were going to buy vs. reuse vs. custom make:

This diagram would serve as the guidance for the rest of manufacturing. After compiling a list of all components, we got to work putting the entire harness in the Solidworks model for the car, something we did for the very first time this year which helped us a lot in keeping everything organized. I created a document to lay out our wire harnessing strategy, and included a detailed step-by-step process which lead to almost zero harness-related faults this year, compared to the constant struggles of the previous year. This proved vital in future years, when we would iterate over the documentation I created and use it to train new members of the team.

Combining a fully CAD-ed harness with a robust strategy allowed for more focus on the other parts of the car, such as our new all-custom ECUs. In addition to harness design, I worked to maintain, integrate, and debug the electrical systems in the car, both hardware and software, and worked on designing a power-switching PCB that served as a fuse box and power distribution module which you can see [here](/projects/first%20PCB%20-%20Power%20distribution%20board).

All the hard work paid off, leading the team to have the earliest driving car in the team's history, and the first endurance finish in the team's EV history! We earned the Engineering the Future award at FSAE New Hampshire for our innovative Low Voltage system design and placed 8th out of 35 teams, and earned the Efficiency award at FSAE Michigan, finishing 20th out of 75 teams.

I learned more this year than I can ever put into a few paragraphs, & I look forward to next year when I'll be taking over responsibility of the entire electrical system.

And of course, I'll never forget the team!
